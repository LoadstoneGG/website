## Independence
Each environment operated by Loadstone is isolated by design. Progress, rules, and
economies do not transfer between environments.

## Lifecycle
Environments may evolve, reset, or shut down when their defined scope is complete.

## Infrastructure
Loadstone maintains centralized identity, security, and observability services.

## Transparency
Operational changes are communicated within each environment’s own channels.
